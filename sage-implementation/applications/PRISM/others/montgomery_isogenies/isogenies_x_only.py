"""
Underneath everything, our isogenies are on the Kummer line

L : x^3 + Ax^2 + x

And we perform our x-only isogenies by working with the x-coordinates
represented projectively as x(P) = (X : Z) which we call KummerPoints

However, for FESTA(+) we always need the full point eventually for either
additions or the (2,2)-isogeny, so we need a way to recover the full point.

The trick we use is that we always evaluate our isogenies on torsion bases,
so we can use the Weil pairing to recover phi(P) up to an overall sign.

This file takes elliptic curves and points on these curves, maps them to the
Kummer line, performs fast x-only isogeny computations and then lifts the
result back to full points on the codomain curves.
